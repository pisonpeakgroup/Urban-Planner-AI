# Urban-Planner-AI
Transform your urban planning ideas into detailed AI 3D
By creating an AI Powered Web app like CityEngine, a 3D city modeling app for urban design, visual effects, and VR/AR production.



Procedural 3D Modeling: Generate cityscapes using rule-based systems (e.g., grammar-based modeling).
GIS Data Integration: Import real-world geographic data for accurate urban layouts.
Scenario Simulation: Allow users to test urban planning scenarios (e.g., traffic flow, zoning).
VR/AR Compatibility: Export models for immersive experiences.
Visual Effects Tools: Enable cinematic rendering for film or game production.



Generative Design: Use AI to propose optimal city layouts based on constraints like population density, green space, or traffic.
Style Transfer for Architecture: Apply architectural styles to buildings using AI image models.
Natural Language Interface: Let users describe what they want ("Create a futuristic downtown with green rooftops") and generate it.

Predictive Analytics: Forecast urban growth or environmental impact using machine learning.
